Reads from the sensors every five minutes and logs the values to a file and to
Google Fusion Tables.

The code for interfacing with the DHT22 temperature/humidity sensor is in the
DHT22 directory.  The sensor's timing requirements are tough to meet
consistently from userspace, so it's a bit ugly, but it works.  It includes a
library (Beagle_GPIO.[ch]) that I did not write.

It uses Linux's tsl2563 driver to control a tsl2561 luminosity sensor.

Run with --noauth_local_webserver to make sure fusion tables make.  Otherwise
it will attempt to open a browser.
