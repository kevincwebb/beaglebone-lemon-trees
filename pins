This is just a cheatsheet for me to record wires and the BBB header to which
they connect.

On the power board:
 -Y,Y,G tied with yellow tape:
  --Y:  Solenoid (Doesn't matter which one).
  --G:  P8, 12

 -Bk,Bk,G tied with green tape:
  --Bk: Solenoid (Doesn't matter which one).
  --G:  P8, 14

On the sensor board:
 -R,Y,Bk,G tied with white tape:
  --R:  VCC on luminosity sensor.
  --Bk: GND on luminosity sensor.
  --Y:  SDA on luminosity sensor.
  --G:  SCL on luminosity sensor.

 -R,Y,Bk tied with green tape:
  --R:  VCC on temp/humidity sensor.
  --Y:  P9, 27
  --Bk: GND on temp/humidity sensor.

 -O,G tied with yellow tape:
  --G:  P9, 19
  --O:  P9, 20

 R,Bk tied with red tape:
  --Bk: P9, 2
  --R:  P9, 4
